# Icon detection + named icon template matching

## Scenario

> When we design ui applications, we often create our own set of icons, but more often, we use open icons set such as material icons.

## Technology (Methods)

## 1. SVG Vector string comparison.

we don't use any ml backends here. we might later to optimize the process, but not for detecting the icon itself. Static CV Algorithms are powerful enought to do this.

## 2. Bitmap template matching.

## 3. CV Object detection
